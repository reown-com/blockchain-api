            This is the WalletConnect Blockchain API (formerly RPC Proxy), a Rust-based service that acts as an RPC proxy for interacting with multiple EVM and non-EVM blockchains.

            Key considerations for this project:
            - Rust-based service using Axum HTTP framework and Tokio async runtime
            - Multi-provider blockchain RPC proxying and load balancing
            - Provider integrations: Pokt Network, Quicknode, Coinbase, Zerion, Allnodes, etc.
            - Redis-based caching and rate limiting infrastructure
            - PostgreSQL database for persistent storage and analytics
            - Prometheus metrics collection and monitoring
            - Security-critical provider API key management
            - Chain abstraction supporting both EVM and non-EVM chains (Solana, Near, etc.)
            - Rate limiting, geo-blocking, and anti-abuse mechanisms
            - Integration with WalletConnect's project registry system
            - WebSocket support for real-time blockchain data
            - Analytics and usage tracking for billing and insights
            - Docker containerization and Terraform infrastructure management
            - Just command runner for development workflows
            - Comprehensive integration testing with Jest/TypeScript
            - Environment-based configuration with sensitive data protection
